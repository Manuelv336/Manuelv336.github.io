        <h3>Lab 02 Reflection: HTML</h3>
         <p>
Learning HTML basics is fun and I think I've got the hang of it. Playing with the tags felt like building a pyramid: I started with the foundation html tag, move up to the head and body, and then the rest of the levels like the header, main, and footer. The body is the main part. I will use the Google Fonts website in the list to see what fonts I’ll add to my future websites, and I use the playground as a sandbox to quickly see how a website looks when I'm testing my code.
Once I had that basic shell together, I wanted to play around with some CSS and semantic tags. I was digging through W3Schools to figure out how to make a site actually readable for everyone. I know the browser doesn't technically need those tags to run, but using things like article just makes the structure feel more meaningful and it's kind of like how I organize training content in my current profession.
I also tried styling my CSS using tag selectors for the body and class selectors for the date-line. It felt pretty easy, almost like matching pieces in a puzzle. I treat every project like a challenge, and it's cool to look at an html file now and actually read what’s going on. Indentation is still a bit of a struggle for me, but I'm getting there.
Honestly, coming from a background in SQL and Python, HTML has been a breeze. I’m a curious person, and I’m really into learning new skills. Building websites has been on my bucket list for a while, and I’m getting pretty excited to keep leveling this project up. Im looking forward to learn how to add tabs, js and incorporate some Excel features.

        <h3>Lab 03 Reflection: External CSS</h3>
        <p>
 Now that I’ve got the html basics down, it’s time to decorate that pyramid with CSS. This is the part I was looking forward to, and it feels a lot like playing a matching game, mapping styles from one file to the other to see how things shift. Honestly, I think this is what gives a website its character; you can make it friendly, professional, or even look like a rainbow if you want. After reading the material, I’ve been asking myself these three questions for every change: Where do I put the code? Should I make these changes inline, internal, or external? What am I targeting? Am I styling the title, the body, or a specific line? and what change am I making? Do I need to adjust the color, font, or alignment? In this case, for lab 3, I was given the what and how and used my creativity to make the changes. I found it easy to complete because it's a basic website with a few lines of code. I'm sure I would struggle if it was a larger website. 
            At first, I did strugle on adding the CSS from a external file but I went back on the reading and find out how to refence the file if its in the same forlder.
