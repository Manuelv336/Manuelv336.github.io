        <h3>Lab 02 Reflection: HTML</h3>
        <p>
            Learning about HTML is quite fun and rewarding. I have learned a lot about the structure of web pages,
            including how to use semantic elements like headers and footers to organize my content.
            There are many resources out there, but using Visual Studio makes it easier and I keep a list of all the HTML
            components so that I can remember them. I’m excited to keep exploring different ways to personalize my site and 
            add more interactive features. The way I started was by adding the HTML and creating a shell that would fill all
            the requirements. Additionally, I have already begun studying Module 3 because I wanted to see how CSS interacts
            with the HTML structure I built here. I manually added a few internal CSS rules, like serif fonts and italics, 
            to test readability. I also included links to resources like Google Fonts and MDN Web Docs. I haven't fully implemented
            a custom font yet, I am keeping these links as part of a CSS cheatsheet. Most of the codes on my personal list come 
            from W3Schools, that’s what I have been using as a primary resource to learn new properties. </p>

        <h3>Lab 03 Reflection: External CSS</h3>
        <p>
    Reflection: In this module, I learned how to personalize my HTML with CSS by using the external stylesheet method. 
    The way I tackled this lab was by creating a checklist of all requirements, such as updating the body, headers h1, h2 and h3, 
    paragraphs, and links. I am used to creating training documentation in Microsoft Word, so I tried applying that same concept of 
    structured formatting to this website to ensure everything was consistent and professional. Initially found it easier to add styles
    directly to the HTML, I now see the benefit of using an external stylesheet to keep my structure and design separate. 
    I used my resources from W3Schools to apply specific Hex codes for my color palette in Visual Studio and implemented a unique ID 
    selector main-header and a class selector  .date-line to target specific elements for styling. I removed the internal style tags 
    from Lab 02 and moved those rules into the external CSS file to better organize my code.
        </p>
