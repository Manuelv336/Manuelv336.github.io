Learning about HTML is quite fun and rewarding. I have learned a lot about the structure of web pages, including how to use semantic elements like headers and footers to organize my content. There are many resources out there, but using Visual Studio makes it easier and I keep a list of all the HTML components so that I can remember them. I’m excited to keep exploring different ways to personalize my site and add more interactive features. The way I started was by adding the HTML and creating a shell that would fill all the requirements. 
Additionally, I have already begun studying Module 3 because I wanted to see how CSS interacts with the HTML structure I built here. I manually added a few internal CSS rules, like serif fonts and italics, to test readability. I also included links to resources like Google Fonts and MDN Web Docs. I haven't fully implemented a custom font yet, I am keeping these links as part of a CSS cheatsheet. Most of the codes on my personal list come from W3Schools, that’s what I have been using as a primary resource to learn new properties.
