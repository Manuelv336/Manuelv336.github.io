Learning HTML basics is fun and I think I've got the hang of it. Playing with the tags felt like building a pyramid: I started with the foundation html tag, move up to the head and body, and then the rest of the levels like the header, main, and footer. The body is the main part. I will use the Google Fonts website in the list to see what fonts I’ll add to my future websites, and I use the playground as a sandbox to quickly see how a website looks when I'm testing my code.
Once I had that basic shell together, I wanted to play around with some CSS and semantic tags. I was digging through W3Schools to figure out how to make a site actually readable for everyone. I know the browser doesn't technically need those tags to run, but using things like article just makes the structure feel more meaningful and it's kind of like how I organize training content in my current profession.
I also tried styling my CSS using tag selectors for the body and class selectors for the date-line. It felt pretty easy, almost like matching pieces in a puzzle. I treat every project like a challenge, and it's cool to look at an html file now and actually read what’s going on. Indentation is still a bit of a struggle for me, but I'm getting there.
Honestly, coming from a background in SQL and Python, HTML has been a breeze. I’m a curious person, and I’m really into learning new skills. Building websites has been on my bucket list for a while, and I’m getting pretty excited to keep leveling this project up. Im looking forward to learn how to add tabs, js and incorporate some Excel features.
